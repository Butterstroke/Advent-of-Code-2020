# Advent-of-Code-2020
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) is an advent calendar of programming puzzles designed for a variety of skill sets and levels. You can use any programming language you like (You can even use different languages for each problem). What matters most is getting the correct answer for the puzzle. 

This year, I'll be doing 100% Javascript (using Node.js). This repository contains my solutions for the puzzles in 2020.

## Running the Code
Simply add an input.txt file to the target day and run the program using either `npm run {part1 or part2}.js` or `node {Day folder}/{part1 or part2}.js`.
